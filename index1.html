        <p>I am a multimedia journalist,a model,a professional actress and a junior software developer who lives
            in kenya. I love swimming and singing at my leisure time, i have worked with different organisations
            which enabled me to know how to relate with people and also got the chance to sharpen my skills.</p><p>
           I worked at Ryce Motors as a receptionist and a sales personel. Before i come to Moringa i was working
            at TV47 as a presenter,director,producer,editor and a camera person.</p><p> I basically joined Moringa School 
            because i am always creative in a way,i mean i can easily peach a project idea but i lack the knowledge
            to impliment it, my dream is that when i come out of Moringa i will be able to come up with an idea 
            and make it work.

        <p>I am a fun loving person with a good personality,something funny about me is that i smile alot even when nothing 
            is actually funny.</p><p>I am a very hardworking person who believes in greatness through toughness because 
            if you want the best then you have to work best.

            <li>I come to Moringa School when i was so green in terms of programming and i actually got scared even
                with simple languanges like css and html, i must say that is has been a very interesting journey
                and i am so ready to move on to the end. I am so glad that through the tough beggining i have gained
                so much and i am so pround that i already have projects that i have done.
