        <p>I am a multimedia journalist,a model,a professional actress and a junior software developer who lives
            in kenya. I love swimming and singing at my leisure time, i have worked with different organisations
            which enabled me to know how to relate with people and also got the chance to sharpen my skills.</p><p>
           I worked at Ryce Motors as a receptionist and a sales personel. Before i come to Moringa i was working
            at TV47 as a presenter,director,producer,editor and a camera person.</p><p> I basically joined Moringa School 
            because i am always creative in a way,i mean i can easily peach a project idea but i lack the knowledge
            to impliment it, my dream is that when i come out of Moringa i will be able to come up with an idea 
            and make it work.
